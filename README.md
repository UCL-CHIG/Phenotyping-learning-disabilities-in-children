Phenotyping learning disabilities in children

## Overview
This project aimed to describe changes in planned and unplanned admission rates before, during and after transition from paediatric to adult care for young people with learning disabilties or autism. 

This repository covers ICD-10 codes used to indicate children with learning disabilities or autism in hospital records in England, and basic Stata code used for analyses of trends in hospital admissions across transition from pediatric to adult care. Preprint is available [here](). Details of code list derivation are described in the appendix.
